                <p>Our Organization, Chasing Antarctica, is a non-profit organization that wants to help fund the next 
                large Antarctic expedition in 2020. If enough money can be raised to fund the expedition. Our scientists 
                will be able to travel to Antarctica and perform research that could help us understand more about 
                Antarctica, it’s inhabitants and about our Earth.
                </p>
                <p>The study of Antarctica is important because it can tell us a lot about the world before human's 
                activity began shaping it. Antarctica holds approximately 70% of our planets fresh water in the form 
                of icebergs/ice sheets, and they are continuously melting. Researching how long and when the ice sheets 
                will melt are important parts of the expedition because sea levels will rise, and warmer climates are 
                inevitable with the melting of Antarctica.
                </p>
                <p>The study of wildlife is also important because some of the animals found in Antarctica cannot be 
                found elsewhere. There are many types of animals, mammals that thrive here, like the Artic Fox, 
                Artic Wolf, Polar bears, Beluga Whale, seals, and of course; penguins. More information on how these 
                animals have adapted to the harsh cold and how they continue to thrive could lead to many new 
                discoveries. Due to climate change, there may be a day where these animals don’t even exist anymore. 
                So, researching and learning more about how these creature's live day by day can help scientist help them.
                </p>
                <p>Usually, expeditions are funded by large cooperation's or by the government. But due financial cuts, 
                Chasing Antarctica has had a large budget cut. To make this expedition a reality, Chasing Antarctica is 
                going to need the help from the community to reach their fundraising goal. Chasing Alaska would like to 
                create a website where they could let donators follow their experiences in Antarctica. Those that donate 
                will get access to newsletters and frequent updates on how the fundraising is going, and eventually get 
                updates on how the expedition is fairing. Chasing Antarctica would also want people who are interested 
                to be a part of the mission by being able to view a personal blog about the expedition. Creating this 
                website overall would make it not just a fundraiser, but it would make it an adventure that both the 
                expedition team and the donators can follow along each step of the way as more discoveries in a place 
                further than the universe.
